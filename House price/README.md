# Project 2 : House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques


# Introduction 

## published Kaggle kernel:

[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/hananxx/house-price-predication)

## Datasets Description 

[House prices ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition named “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques”. It contains 1460 training data,1459 testing data and 80 features about houses and sales information.

## Executive Summary
After investigating the dataset, we built several machine learning models to predict the selling price of new houses. we reach lowest RMSE with Gradient Boosting Regressor approximtly 0.14

## Problem Statment

The project aims to predict the sale prices of new houses, which is given in the dataset, the problem is a supervised learning problem. Since house sales prices are continuous, this is a regression problem.


# Data Dictionary

- TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area
- OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house
- Fireplaces: Number of fireplaces
- FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade
- GarageArea: Size of garage in square feet
- YearBuilt: Original construction date
- GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- MasVnrArea: Masonry veneer area in square feet
- YearRemodAdd: Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions)
- OpenPorchSF: Open porch area in square feet
- BsmtFinSF1: Type 1 finished square feet
- WoodDeckSF: Wood deck area in square feet
- LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property



## Conclusions and Recommendations

Our findings in this study are that the house sale price affected by the built year also, the location zone seems to be important as well in deciding house price. There are also other features that play roles in affecting the sale price of the house like the total area of its basement, the living area, kitchen's quality, its foundation, and the neighborhood of the house. Our target was predicting house sale price based on features.
